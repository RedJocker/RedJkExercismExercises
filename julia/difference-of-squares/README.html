<p>Find the difference between the square of the sum and the sum of the squares of the first N natural numbers.</p>

<p>The square of the sum of the first ten natural numbers is
(1 + 2 + &#8230; + 10)² = 55² = 3025.</p>

<p>The sum of the squares of the first ten natural numbers is
1² + 2² + &#8230; + 10² = 385.</p>

<p>Hence the difference between the square of the sum of the first
ten natural numbers and the sum of the squares of the first ten
natural numbers is 3025 - 385 = 2640.</p>

<p>You are not expected to discover an efficient solution to this yourself from
first principles; research is allowed, indeed, encouraged. Finding the best
algorithm for the problem is a key skill in software engineering.</p>
